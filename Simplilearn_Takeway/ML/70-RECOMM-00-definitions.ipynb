    "# What is a recommender system?\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommender system is a type of information filtering system. By drawing from huge data sets, the system’s algorithm can pinpoint accurate user preferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know what your users like, you can recommend them new, relevant content. And that’s true for everything from movies and music etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix, YouTube, Tinder and Amazon are all examples of recommender systems in use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems can also enhance experiences for:\n",
    "\n",
    "    News Websites\n",
    "    Computer Games\n",
    "    Knowledge Bases\n",
    "    Social Media Platforms\n",
    "    Stock Trading Support Systems\n",
    "    \n",
    "** The LONG tail problem **\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of regular malls, departmental stores we only see a limited number of items to buy. There’s only so much space.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, recommending customers things to buy is easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the front of the store we put items of iterest on display. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of __online__ purchases, you’re presented with millions of options. And if you don’t know what you’re looking for, you might find the sheer number of options __overwhelming__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is known as the __long tail__ problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "** Bottom line ** -- If you want to provide user with targeted choices, recommender systems are the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few examples - (amazon.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "For books category ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Books bestsellers\n",
    "- Hot new releases\n",
    "\n",
    "But once you start making choices on the platform, Amazon’s recommender system takes over. e.g. \"Customer who bought this item, also bought\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Recommender Systems Provide Users with Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using machine learning, recommender systems provide you with suggestions in a few ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A. Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - B. Content-based Filtering\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - C. Hybrid (Combination of Both)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### (A) Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A collaborative filtering recommender system analyzes similarities between users and/or item interactions. Once the system identifies similarities, it serves users recommendations. In general, users see items that similar users liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular examples of collaborative filtering systems include Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of collaborative filtering systems including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Item-item Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - User-user Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### (1) Item-item Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Amazon__ invented item-item filtering for their recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An item-item filtering algorithm analyzes product associations taken from user ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, you rate a book or movie as a 10/10. Now, you will see the top rated books or movies with similar attributes. Below is an example from Goodreads.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I created a special list for books that I gave five-star ratings. __Goodreads__ then recommends me the highest ranked books from __similar readers’__ lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the _“people who viewed this item also bought”_ -- also an item-item filtering system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Item filtering __works best__ when you have more users on your platform than items._\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) User-user Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "- takes the similarity of __user tastes__ into consideration\n",
    "- create clusters of other people with similar tastes\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - \n",
    "\n",
    "    - you use YouTube for the first time. You play a ARIJIT SINGH's song. The system clusters you with other users who also like ARIJIT SINGH's songs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Then the YouTube recommendation system shows you other songs chosen by users in your cluster. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The more choices you make, the more relevant the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (B) Content Based Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content based filtering uses characteristics or properties of an item to serve recommendations. Characteristic information includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Characteristics of Items (Keywords and Attributes)\n",
    "    - Characteristics of Users (Profile Information)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use a movie recommendation system as an example. Characteristics for the item Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Director Name – Chris Columbus\n",
    "    Genres – Adventure, Fantasy, Family (IMDB)\n",
    "    Stars – Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say they choose Swiss Army Man next. It’s safe to assume the user likes movies starring Daniel Radcliffe. The system tracks these choices and begins to recommend Daniel Radcliffe films.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis is that if a user liked an item in the past, they might like similar items in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Issue with of Recommender systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- COLLABORATIVE FILTERING \n",
    "    - needs a lot of data \n",
    "    - For example, when John visits YouTube for the first time, the system has to wait on him to watch several videos. Only then can it serve him relevant recommendations for other videos.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Solution\n",
    "        - clustering , multiple clusters\n",
    "        - start by recommending users popular items\n",
    "        - request new users to provide more information\n",
    "        \n",
    "- CONTENT BASED\n",
    "    - request users to provide more information (likes etc)\n",
    "    "
